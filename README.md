# GH-API-Practice


This purposeful practice project is from Eric Matthes project-based programming book titled "Python Crash Course".

The sole purpose of this project was to practice and hone my Python-API skills using GitHub API. Application Programming Interfaces (or APIs) are a popular and reliable data source because data will be up-to-date and can exhibit synergy with programming languages (i.e. Python). This repository showcases the various methods that programmers can use for data-based projects regarding APIs. 

This repositry also serves as a reference as I plan on using APIs in future personal and professional projects.
